# Detailed Description:
This is a very simple mod that adds two flags to the prefabs for any prop that includes these in the name of the prefab:
* Wall
* Hedge
* Railing
* Fence
* Gate
* Shed
* Bed
* Room

The two flags make it so the props stay vertical and do not rotate due to terrain and so that the prop can be submerged into the terrain sometimes. 
The game is still determining what position and rotation to put these sub-elements. I'm not manipulating them individually per asset instance.

This mod helps a lot with prop fences that are used for assets on steep zoned streets including those in the Japan and UK region packs.

The mod is not perfect, it will look good sometimes, and look better than vanilla others times, and sometimes may not look as good as you'd want. If a sub-element doesn't look as good as you want you can use Anarchy, EDT, and DevUI Debug Toggle  for persistent changes to the position/rotation of sub-elements.

There are no settings and no UI.

# Support
I will respond on the code modding channels on Cities: Skylines Modding Discord.
